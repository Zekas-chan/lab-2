> **Part I**
> 1. Given *n* (n ≥ 3) distinct elements, design two algorithms to compute the first three smallest elements using an incremental and a divide-and-conquer approach, respectively. Both your algorithms should return a triple (x, y, z) such that x < y < z < (the rest n-3 input elements) and run in linear time in the worst case. Show that your algorithms are correct and calculate the *exact* number of comparisons used by the algorithms. You may assume that n = 3 x 2^k-1 for some positive integer k. *Hint: One can use the induction technique to show the correctness. Check Chapter 4 for more examples of performance analyses.*

> 2. Design two divide and conquer algorithms that, given an array A = (a1, a2 ... an) of positive real numbers, n ≥ 2, compute the maximum value max{af/ai | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}. Your algorithms should run in Θ(n log n) time and O(n) time in the worst case, respectively. Analyze your algorithms. You may assume that n = 2^k for some positive integer k.
